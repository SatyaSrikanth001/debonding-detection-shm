# Debonding Detection in Stiffened Panels

This repository implements a machine learning system for detecting and assessing early-stage debonding in stiffened panels using guided waves, as described in the research paper:

Kumar, A., Banerjee, S., & Guha, A. (2024). "Guided Wave-Based Early-Stage Debonding Detection and Assessment in Stiffened Panel Using Machine Learning With Deep Auto-Encoded Features." ASME Journal of Nondestructive Evaluation, Diagnostics and Prognostics of Engineering Systems.

## Features

- Guided wave signal processing and analysis
- Advanced data augmentation techniques
- Harmonic feature extraction
- Deep Convolutional Autoencoder (DCAE) for feature compression
- Stacked ensemble machine learning model
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
